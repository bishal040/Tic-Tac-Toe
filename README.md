# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game A simple two-player game implemented in Java.The idea came during my exam preparation and I brought it to life afterward.The game features input validation,win detection and an option to restart after each game.Players take turns entering moves in a clean consolebased interface.Fun,interactive and great example of Java programming!
